### [Resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HqCspncpNP31ns-R4zuZHlaF6cYVFCS5UfRx_gPu-xw/edit?usp=sharing)

```
Former retail management professional leveraging strong interpersonal skills and leadership experience in my journey to software engineering. 
After successfully managing operations and teams of 30+ at Cinemark, I've redirected my passion for problem-solving toward building innovative technical solutions.

My background in customer service has shaped my approach to developmentâ€”I create with the end-user in mind and thrive in collaborative environments. 
I'm currently pursuing my BS in Computer Science at Bellevue College, graduating in June 2025, and actively applying my technical skills through projects like EmailEssence and Reverb XR.

I bring a unique blend of operational expertise and technical capabilities, with experience in C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, and Java. 
My management background has equipped me with communication skills that bridge the gap between technical solutions and user needs.
I'm seeking opportunities where I can contribute my technical skills, collaborative approach, and passion for creating impactful solutions. 

Open to software engineering roles and internships that will allow me to continue growing as a developer.
