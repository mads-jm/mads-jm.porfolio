[Resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HqCspncpNP31ns-R4zuZHlaF6cYVFCS5UfRx_gPu-xw/edit?usp=sharing)

```
Machine Learning Engineer at EdgeRunner AI, building on a foundation in retail management. My experience leading large teams taught me to solve problems by focusing on people first—a philosophy I now bring to software engineering, where I am passionate about building intuitive, user-focused solutions.

I thrive in collaborative environments that bridge the gap between technical implementation and real-world user needs. My current work involves Python, TypeScript, Bash, and PowerShell, all supported by my recent B.S. in Computer Science from Bellevue College.

Excited to be applying and growing my skills to help build efficient, impactful software. Let's connect!
